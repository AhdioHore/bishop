Bishop
=============

Bishop is a Chrome extension that will hunt websites you browse for files that contain a given string - it will find you Git repos, exposed config files, open `cgi-bin`s, web accessible etc/passwd files, and more.

Installation
=============
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Navigate to chrome://extensions
3. Expand the developer dropdown menu and click "Load Unpacked Extension"
4. Navigate to `bishop/src` folder
5. Assuming there are no errors, the extension should load into your browser

Adding Rules to the Code
=============
If you have a general interest rule that you think others could find helpful, feel free to PR the `options_demo.js`. The fields are pretty self explanatory and match the GUI rule addition interface. The `uid` field can be left as is; it's just adding the unique ID for the rule. Risk is intended to describe the relative amount of problems scanning the wrong site with the rule could cause -- e.g. getting scanned for open phpMyAdmin installs is pretty much par for the course for 99% of web servers and is low risk, but punching at a bunch of variations of `../../../../../etc/passwd` grabs could irk some people and is high risk. It's all relative, but use your best judgement.
